#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic approach of application of software engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. This entails software product design, development, testing, deployemnt and maintenance. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. Structured programming. This marked the transition to a more organized approach to coding.
ii. Object oriented programming. This was the introduction of concepts like classes and objects in programming
iii. Agile methodologies. This focused on fexibiliity and collaborative working. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Planning - This is the stage where the project is defined and its scope is discussed.
ii. Design - This is where the projects specifications are designed and the architecture is created.
iii. Development - This is the coding stage.
iv. Testing - This is the verification stage to affirm the software meets requirements.
v. Deployment - At this stage, the software is released to users.
vi. Maintenance - This is the provision of updates and support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
While both focus on efficiency in software engineering as far as the respective projects are concerned, waterfall methodologies are linear and sequential. The latter means that in its implementation, each phase has to be completed before the next begins and its best suited for construction and other well defined requirements projects. Agile methodologies on the other hand are iterative and incremental, meaning they are segmented into small manageable units. An example is a software start up.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i. A software developer is responsible for writing and maintaining codes, debugging potential issues and implentation of updates and new features.
ii. A quality Assurance Enginner is resposible for development and execution of test plans and ensuring the software quality is upto standard.
iii. A project manager is responsible for planning, execution and general management of the team and resources. They also communicate with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environment improve productivity through the provision of necessary tools for coding, debugging and testing a single interface. An example is the Visual Studio Code. The Version Control Systems is crucail in tracking changes, facilitating collaboration and effective management of code versions. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges software engineers experience include managing complexity and keeping up with the constant technological changes. To overcome these two, software engineers can implement modular design techniques and practice continuous learning and professional development respectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i. Unit testing is used for testing single components for correctness.
ii. Intergration testing is used in ensuring combined components work together.
iii. System testing facilitates validating the complete and integrated software.
iv. Acceptance texting is done to confirm the software meets requirements and is ready.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering entails coming up with precise and effective prompts to interact with AI models. The latter is done to ensure accurate and relevant respones. Prompt engineering is essential for maximizing the utility of AI in diverse applications. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt - "Tell me something about Digital Marketing."
Improved prompt - "Explain in detail digital marketing channels, discussing the key components of the same and give a SWOT analysis of individual channels."
The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies the information needed and focuses on a component of digital marketing while eliminating ambiguity.
